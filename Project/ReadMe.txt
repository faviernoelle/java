Problem: Cccupancy estimators
Author: Noelle FAVIER
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

OBJECTIVE
- Develop a tool in Java to support the design of occupancy estimators for an office


CONSTRAINTS
- Delivered code must comply with the Java naming standard and be easy to read. 
- It must be objected oriented

HOW TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
1. design a graphic user interface to generate plots with selected variables, 
in order to be able to visualize measurements as well as new generated data
2. develop an occupancy estimator based on laptop power consumptions
3. develop an occupancy estimator based on motion detections
4. develop an occupancy estimator based on CO2 concentrations
5. analyze the results and summarize


STRUCTURE OF THE FOLDER
* To open the project :
-- Open NetBeans IDE
-- File --> Open Project --> Select the project
-- All dependecies should appear in the project view of NetBeans

* main function is 

* powerLaptop_ is called in 
-- PlotTimeChart
